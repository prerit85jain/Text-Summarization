Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that work and react like humans. Some of the activities computers with artificial intelligence are designed for include speech recognition, learning, planning, and problem solving. AI has been around for decades, but recent advances in machine learning and deep learning have accelerated its development and adoption across various industries. Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers to analyze various factors of data. These technologies are being used in applications ranging from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis systems. The field continues to evolve rapidly, with new breakthroughs occurring regularly in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. However, AI also raises important ethical considerations regarding privacy, job displacement, and decision-making transparency that society must address as these technologies become more prevalent.
